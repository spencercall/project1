    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a 21 year old man living in Sammamish, Washington. I have been interested in busniness related things since I was young and thought of many things about what I would want to do in the future. I had taken multiple business related courses in high school and college. When I went to college, I started to become more intrested in BATECH. Technology is growing every day, and I thought learning more about business and technology together might be a great way to adapt to the future and have a chance at a good career that I would enjoy.</p>
